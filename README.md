I'm just getting started with Tampermonkey and uploading some basic scripts I've created by foraging for code scraps across the internet. Ideally I'll be able to host them here on github and access them from multiple computers.

All scripts going forward should be set up to prompt for installation when viewing the RAW (if you decide you want a copy of them for whatever reason). Below are a list of the available scripts and their purposes.

## Scripts
* [Big Blaseball Additional](#BigBlaseBallAdditional.js) 
  - _**Note: Requires the core [Big Blaseball](https://userstyles.org/styles/187551/big-blaseball) script**_
  - This is a further adjustment of the existing work in that script, sort of like an expansion pack that include some personal adjustments to the larger view of the [Blaseball](https://www.blaseball.com) website that the script provides.
* [Cruncyroll Dark Theme](#CrunchyrollDarkTheme.user.js)
  - Currently still in development, this simply changes the background color of the body to a less abrasive color on the Crunchyroll website
  - More work needs to be done to effectively re-color all elements and I'm not regularly using this website anymore so use this at your own discretion.
* [Fandom Cleaner](#FandomCleaner.user.js)
  - Drastically alters the layout of Fandom Wiki pages to make them more readable. Removes numerous unnecessary elements.
* [(Unfuck the) Harry Potter Wiki](#HarryPotterWiki.user.js)
  - _**Note: This script is depreacted and has been worked into the broader Fandom Cleaner script**_
  - This is where it all began. Annoyed by the excessive visual noise on the Fandom Harry Potter wiki page, I wrote this up to remove the garbage once and for all. Once I realized this could be applied to all Fandom Wiki pages universally it was converted over.
* [Reddit Test](#RedditTest.js)
  - Currently only removes promoted posts (or attempts to). Not 100% sure htis is working or will stay working so I'm leaving the "Test" tag on it.
