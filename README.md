This repo logs custom stylesheets I've made for myself over time. They're intended to be used with the browser extension Stylus (avaiable for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne))

## Styles

* [Blaseball 2023 Restyle](https://github.com/eltrov/Custom-Userstyles/blob/master/Blaseball%202023%20Restyle.user.css)
  - With the re-launch of Blaseball in 2023, I've started fresh with a new custom stylesheet for [Blaseball](https://blaseball.com). I've tuned this specifically to my liking but feel free to fork it and make any changes you deem necessary.
  - I've based this custom style around a 3440x1440 display but I've included some catches that should make it work just as well on a 1080p monitor. With anything else you're on your own.
