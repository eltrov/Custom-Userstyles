I'm just getting started with Tampermonkey and uploading some basic scripts I've created by foraging for code scraps across the internet. Ideally I'll be able to host them here on github and access them from multiple computers.

All scripts going forward should be set up to prompt for installation when viewing the RAW (if you decide you want a copy of them for whatever reason).
