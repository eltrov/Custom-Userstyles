I've recently discovered the Stylus extension (for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)) which allows me to easily write pure CSS and replace existing stylings. As I was only using TamperMonkey for restyling before, I've coverted my main scripts over to the new format and will be using this going forward for updates and making new styles.

## Stles

* [Fandom Cleaner](#FandomCleaner.user.css)
  - Drastically alters the layout of Fandom Wiki pages to make them more readable. Removes numerous unnecessary elements.
* [Fandom Dark Mode](#FandomDarkMode.user.css)
  - _**Note: This is designed & intended to be used alongside the main Fandom Cleaner script.**_
  - Gives Fandom pages a dark theme of my own styling. Primary colors are #222426 (dark blue-ish grey) for the backgrounds and #dddbd9 (beige) for text.
* [Big Screen Blaseball - Expansion Pack](#BSB-ExpansionPack.user.css) 
  - _**Note: Requires the core [Big Screen Blaseball](https://holmesmr.github.io/Blaseball-Userstyles/) style**_
  - A collection of my personal style changes on top of the existing Big Screen Blaseball style set. Intended for use with [Blaseball](https://www.blaseball.com) on the default dark-mode and optimized for a 3440x1440 monitor.
